This is due to the fact that the zip was built on a different server than the one that I extracted to.  The solution is found at the BOTTOM of this article: http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bs2bkwxc(VS.80).aspx<br /><br />In summary, delete all of the extracted files, right click on the zip and click properties, click on the Unblock button and say OK.  Reextract and you're all set<br />",
