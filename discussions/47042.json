Although it works well, I've encounterd a problem: In a specific case, I need to click on a link button before I'll try to process the page. The link button itself casuses a postback by pointing to the following href:<br>\r\nÂ &quot;<em>javascript:__doPostBack('ctl00$SideMenu1$aSrc','')</em>&quot;<br>\r\nI've tried to call formProcessor.Web.Load() with the specific JS code but with no success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder if anyone has a solution to this specific problem? Any help will be greatly appreciated! :-)<br>\r\nThank you very much, and have a pleasent day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadav Yeheskel,<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.any-techs.co.il\">www.any-techs.co.il</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.any-techs.com\">www.any-techs.com</a>\r\n",

I know search engine crawlers do stuff like this, but I'd imagine the best approach for them is to literally fork code from browser code to keep behaviour consistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless you've got google resources, might be best to load an instance of a browser exe from your app, then create a pipe between that server-side browser instance and your application.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat way, the page will behave properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm sure someone on the net has tried/done this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
