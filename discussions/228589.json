I included a sample phone application that gets a list of links</p>\r\n<p>Removing xpath, hashtable and arraylist had already been done in the current SVN codebase after the 1.4.0 release. I did a HAPLight project for Silverlight 4.0 which paved most of the way for the WP7 version. I really hope that the next version of WP7 is upgraded to SL4. Too many things missing, implicit styles, direct content for buttons, improved XAML parsing...</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
