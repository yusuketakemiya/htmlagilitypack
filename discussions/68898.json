I want it to skip only one line, same as if you press shift + enter (while still having the same functionality as just enter).</p>\r\n<p>I think in Word the default is 2 lines for a new paragraph as well. Is it possible to make it like Outlook so it's just one line for a new paragraph?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>",
