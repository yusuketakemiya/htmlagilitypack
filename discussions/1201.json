However, I want to save the href/img attribute in the text as well.<br /><br />In the files I am running across malformed tags with links in them like<br />&lt;http://linkwithoutatag&gt; and I want to capture the data in the tag if it contains http.  What is the best way to capture this data.  When this happens the node does not seem to have any innertext / innerhtml etc?<br /><br />THanks<br />Darrell<br />",
