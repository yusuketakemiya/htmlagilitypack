The problem you seem to be running into is your use of '&lt;' and '&gt;' characters.</p>\r\n<p>These characters are used as mark-up for the document itself. Try replacing them with &quot;&amp; l t ;&quot; and &quot;&amp; g t ;&quot; (without the quotes and spaces)<br>\r\n<br>\r\ne.g. &lt;extract&gt; Nullable &amp; l t ;int &amp; g t ; c = null; &lt;/extract&gt;</p>\r\n<p>Haven't had the opportunity to try this myself but by all indications it should work.
