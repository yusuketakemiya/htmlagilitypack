Doesn't work. When I have &quot;page&quot; do a ToString, it contains HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlDocument.<br />\n<br />\nI assume the agility pack can do this. Originally, I was going to do the search, download the page, search it, then delete it. But I came across this and saw it could read on-the-fly.<br />\n",
