It takes the HTML and creates a hierarchical object structure.&nbsp; To do what you need you'll have to use a rendering engine like the .NET WebBrowser control or the Gecko# library. The first allows you to use Internet Explorer to render a page, the later uses to the Gecko rendering engine found in Firefox. Even with those I'm not sure if the x/y coordinates are easily available, it may take some work doing hit testing to find out</p>",
