    "Html": "<p>It seems to me that the caching feature of HtmlWeb&nbsp;doesn't take URL parameters into account. Am I correct?</p>\r\n<p>This is bad because it makes the cache unusable with any dynamic page (e.g. <a href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3169\">Details.aspx?id=3169</a>&nbsp;with a varying id).</p>\r\n<p>Also, it would be nice if the cache supported multithreading. Currently it just throws an exception because the file is already in use. Web access often has a big latency and it's very useful (performance-wise) to request several pages at the same time. Currently to do so, one has to deactivate the HtmlWeb cache.</p>",
