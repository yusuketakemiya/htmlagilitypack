    "Html": "\r\nHi Ernst,<br /><br />This is because by default, Forms are parsed as empty nodes - this is because forms are allowed to overlap other elements in the HTML spec.<br /><br />In other words, the following is technically legal HTML, even though it gives us developer hives:<br /><br />&lt;table&gt;<br />&lt;form&gt;<br />&lt;some input elements&gt;<br />&lt;/table&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt;<br /><br />Here, the form overlaps the closing of the table and when properly rendered, will be contained inside the table.  Since HtmlDocument attempts to allow this as valid without automatically correcting the HTML, HtmlDocument by default makes no attempt to populate the child nodes of the form.<br /><br />Ok.  All that is merely an introduction.  You can get around this default behavior by adding the following line:<br /><br />HtmlNode.ElementsFlags.Remove(\"form\");<br /><br />before you make ANY use of HtmlDocument.  This will allow it to parse the nodes of the form, but it sacrifices the ability of the form to overlap other nodes.  It will force the form to be closed properly.<br /><br />If you have a reasonable assurance that your HTML will be well-formed, this is probably not a problem.  For commercial web sites, this is probably a good bet, as most of them use page builders nowadays instead of hand-coding the HTML.  I wouldn't have said that 2 or 3 years ago; but there's been alot of emphasis on standards recently since the browser wars are heating up again.<br />",

I see some people really start to understand the Html Agility Pack :-)<br /><br /></div><br />Thanks Simon!  Finding this library was, for me, like seeing the light after centuries of darkness.  It's the only elegant, simple approach to HTML parsing I have ever seen - all the others attempt to do too much and be too smart.  Why create a litany of HTML node types when you know you're going to need to look for a \"td\", for example, anyway?  It just complicates things.<br /><br />Off topic: Given any thought to incorporating the FormProcessor into the core codebase?  I've also gone through all the comments.. on every blog/board you've used to post this project.. and incorporated every bug fix or feature addition I've found that I thought would be useful.  The project could certainly use a refresh :)<br />",
