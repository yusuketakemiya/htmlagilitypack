The program needs to do a lot of tree operations (add/delete nodes, runs tree matching algorithm, and etc). <br />Is it better to construct a new DOM tree (by keep calling HtmlNode.ChildNodes() )? Or it's completely unnecessary?<br /><br />Another quick question...how can I access the root node of the DOM tree? Is the following call right?<br />HtmlNode root = htmlDoc.SelectSingleNode(path)<br />",
