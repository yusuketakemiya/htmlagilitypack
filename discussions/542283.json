Download the package from this Codeplex project, and put it somewhere you can find it in your project folder. Then right-click on &quot;References&quot; in your project, just like you would get a NuGet package, except select &quot;Add Reference&quot; this time. Then go to &quot;Browse&quot; and locate the HtmlAgilityPack.dll file from the &quot;winrt45&quot; folder.\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm not sure if everything works, but everything I use it for does work.<br />\n",
