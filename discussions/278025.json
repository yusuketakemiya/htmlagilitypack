For example I got some  null tag elements, and so on!</p>\n<p>I check every link and page and I'm 100% sure it's not a code/xpath syntax problem, moreover these exceptions are absolutely random: same page can generate them or not!</p>\n<p>So I ask: do I have to wait for some time after doc.Load? Or do I have to close the document at the end?(I can't see any Close() method, though...)</p>",
