What's the status of this project?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like the issues, patches and discussions are piling up without notice from contributors. It would be nice if the authors opened up the project a little. I will happily contributing patches and fix bugs if I knew there was a chance of integration, but there hasn't been any word from authors in a long while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe someone else has information about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI personally would like a handful of changes:<br>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Upgrade to 3.5 and generics</li>\r\n    <li>Fix of some various known bugs</li>\r\n    <li>Fizzler integration (http://code.google.com/p/fizzler/)</li>\r\n    <li>HtmlDoc to XDoc converter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nRegards,<br>\r\nCV<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
