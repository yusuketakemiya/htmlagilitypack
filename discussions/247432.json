That one is listed as version 1.9.0.1 and should not be used, thus the name Experimental</p>\r\n<p>Trunk builds just fine for me. Do not use the fx.4.0 project, that was an experimental test of trying to use the .NET 4.0 dynamic features. Use the main HtmlAgilityPack project under trunk. I downloaded the changeset zip file and it built without a problem through both the HtmlAgilityPack2010.sln and&nbsp;HtmlAgilityPack20008.sln solution files&nbsp;</p>",
