I suppose it is something to do with Xpath expression that returns incorrect nodes in the nodeset. Also,sometimes\r\n<a>tag has no href attribute, i.e. link as Ajax navigation element. &nbsp;So, try to run your Xpath on the page using something like Xpath checker for Firefox and watch the output.</p>\r\n<p>If you can provide the example page where your app malfunctions and piece of code for link extraction, I can be more specific.</p>\r\n</a>",
