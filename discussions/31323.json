But in order to proceed some relative XPath queries, I need the context to be updated during each iteration, which, I understand why, is not done automatically. But is there a way, other than using a XPath query, to set the _currentNode to some specific node (like myNode) ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas Hosseini<br>\r\n",
