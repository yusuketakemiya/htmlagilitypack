Only thing that slightly worries me is that the project doesn't look very active. What are the plans? Are there still bug fixes being made when encountered?</p>\r\n<p>Keep up the great work, great job. If you guys would charge perhaps $100 for this library that would be quite reasonable still even. I'd rather pay some cash and have active development than something free that ends up dead (it's more costly to switch to another component in the future).</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>Wout</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
