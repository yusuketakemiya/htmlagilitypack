The xml document generated by Html Agility Pack has different structure as the IE DOM tree. <br /><br />With xpath: \"/html/body/table/tr/td<a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/htmlagilitypack/Wiki/View.aspx?title=%40class%3d%27ContentPane%27\">@class='ContentPane'</a>/center/table/tr/td/li/ul<a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/htmlagilitypack/Wiki/View.aspx?title=%40class%3d%27compactlist%27\">@class='compactlist'</a>/li/a\", the IE DOM can get the deepest level links, but xml document has a wrong tree structure.<br /><br />I used to have similar problems, but fixed by using OptionFixNestedTags. But this time, I tried all different options without any luck.<br /><br />Does anyone know how to fix it?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tong<br />",
