HAPLight for silverlight, HAPCompact for .NET CF 3.5, HtmlAgilityPack.fx.4.0 for .NET 4.0 features and HtmlAgilityPack.Tests for unit tests. The first 3 should be considered alphas and thus there will be no binary releases for them. When I feel like they've reached a usable level I will make beta binary releases for them.</p>",
