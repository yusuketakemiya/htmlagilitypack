So, I posted this on discussion.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I currently try to parse each HtmlNode and it's xpath by tag name. After I&nbsp;initially&nbsp;load document through &nbsp;htmlDocument.Load( string html ) and select nodes by tag, all of htmlNode in htmlDocument.DocumentNodes lose their reference to its\r\n parent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Please let me know if you have any idea.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
