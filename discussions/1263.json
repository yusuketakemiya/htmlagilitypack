It is leveraged backstage by XPATH queries or XSLT transformations.<br /><br />For example, when you do this;<br /><br />HtmlNodecollection links = doc.DocumentNode.SelectNodes(\".//a<a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/htmlagilitypack/Wiki/View.aspx?title=%40href\">@href</a>\");<br /><br />the selectNodes uses HtmlNodeNavigator...<br />Hope this helps<br />Simon.<br />",
