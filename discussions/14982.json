One side effect of this is that the OPTION node in <br />{\"<br />   &lt;select&gt;&lt;option&gt;Option text&lt;/option&gt;<br />\"}<br /><br />has no innerText or innerHtml, because strictly, the above is not HTML (it's XHTML), and so you cannot get the text value above. ASP.NET SELECT controls generate XHTML-style OPTIONs, and so you expect to be able to get the text as well. <br /><br />Great news is that it's easy to change. To change this, simply comment out the exception in HtmlNode.cs, line 91:<br /><br />{\"<br />    // JRH 070910 REMOVED to become XHTML compliant<br />    // ElementsFlags.Add(\"option\", HtmlElementFlag.Empty);<br /><br />\"}<br /><br />You will then get InnerHtml and InnerText being set for your OPTION tags. <br /><br />Enjoy!<br />",
