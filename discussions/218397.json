The capitalization is actually how it is in the document. The correction to this to get it into xhtml seems to put all the &lt;/li&gt; tags at the end which is understandable but I would say wrong. The schema for the xml I am trying to produce actually won't support it in that format, it doesn't like the nesting of &lt;li&gt; in &lt;li&gt;.</p>",
