That is the html data that I need to parse, not the stored file on the server. All the examples that I have seen seem to point only to downloading the HTML file first.&nbsp; This is not available to me.&nbsp; It seems as if I need to use the system.IO.stream overload, but can't find any examples of how to do it.&nbsp; Any ideas/suggestions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks!<br>\r\n",
