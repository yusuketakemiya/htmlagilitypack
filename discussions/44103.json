    "Html": "Hi, I'm trying to use XPATH queries coming out the Firebug Firefox plugin to identify and get content of html elements. You'll get a XPATH using the &quot;inspect&quot; tool in Firebug and selecting &quot;Copy Xpath&quot; from the context menu on the element in the HTML pane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe XPath resulting is something like:<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /html/body/form/table/tbody/tr/td/div/div/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td/div/div/div/div/table/tbody/tr/td/a/div <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's something like a simple &quot;position&quot; in the DOM tree, but it doesn't return anything, at least on the pages I tested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs there a limitation for thsi kind of queries. Did anyone use something like this with success?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiorgio<br>\r\n",
