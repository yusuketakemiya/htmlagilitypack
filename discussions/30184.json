I want to find all &quot;&lt;h1&gt;&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;tags, for example,&nbsp;on a page so I thought the best way was to adapt one of the examples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I tried this line&nbsp;<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:13px;color:#008080\">\r\n<p>HtmlNodeCollection</p>\r\n</span>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:13px\">atts = _doc.DocumentNode.SelectNodes(</span><span style=\"font-size:13px;color:#800000\">&quot;//h1&quot;</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">);\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever it always returns null - the document definately contains heading tags and that is the correct XPath expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I've&nbsp;missed something&nbsp;- but what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks for any help<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJC<br>\r\n",

For example I pointed the sample code 'GetDocLinks' at&nbsp;'<a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_hn.asp\">http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_hn.asp</a>' and all it returned was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinked urls:<br>\r\n/favicon.ico<br>\r\n/stdtheme.css<br>\r\nReferenced urls:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also completely failed to pick out any other tags. SO - does anyone have recommendations for what's happning or perhaps another product with better support material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks<br>\r\n",
