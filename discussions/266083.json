I really appreciate it.................</p>\n<p>The problem is the way my application is designed. Basically it is a GUI application whereby user browses to 'ANY' web forum. I have</p>\n<p>one textbox whereby it uploads the HTML contents and the other textbox which is using regex, cleans the HTML contents of textbox1 and inputs it into</p>\n<p>textbox2 ready for tranfer to the database along with the web URL.</p>\n<p>Regex only works upto a certain limit whereby it struggles to cope if the right regex arent mentioned in the code.</p>\n<p>Hence, why I have turned towards htmlagilitypack :D</p>\n<p>After reading the above, is there anything HAP can help me with where it can be again 'ANY' forum?</p>\n<p>Please advice.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",
