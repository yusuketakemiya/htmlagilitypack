The html returned is from the first frame containing the frameset tag. I cant get HAP to get the html for the frame containing the translation itself. Using the link from the frame's src attribute again load a multi-frame page and the html returned is again the first frame. Any ideas?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>",
