Since there aren't any dll files, I thought: I'll publish it first and use that dll. However, I'm using Visual Studio C# Express to open HtmlAgilityPack.sln, but it needs to convert it first. When I accept it, It sais that &quot;solution folders are not accepted in this version of  the application. Solution folder 'samples' will be unavailable.&quot;<br>\r\nAfter this, I tried publishing this to use the dll, but it won't work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan please someone explain to me what to do to get me started ? It would be greatly appreciated !!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks !<br>\r\n",
