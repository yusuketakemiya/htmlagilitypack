Except for the last, simplest one.\r<br />\n<code>doc.DocumentNode.SelectNodes(&quot;//B&quot;);</code> returns null. It shouldn't. It should return a single node.\r<br />\nI thought my XPath was off, but loading the same XML string as a <code>System.Xml.Document</code> and running <code>SelectNodes(&quot;//B&quot;);</code> Does indeed return the desired node.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhat am I doing wrong?<br />\n",
