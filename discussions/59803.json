Essentially, I am limited to 1 user ID/pw (I can probably ask for 10 more) to the targeted web application. How do I manage my connections, effectively connection pool, using a 1 or a few user ID/pw, similar to database connection pool? Also, is HAP multi-threaded? If I can't pool the existing connections, I can have the web service consumer submitting individual user ID/pw instead.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for your insight</p>\r\n<p>Al</p>",
