Thank you for making it :)\r\n\r\nNaturally I have a question :)\r\n\r\nI was playing with table extraction, and I have made some progress already. I need to extract some data from imdb.com (Movies).\r\n\r\nI experimented a lot and found out that following piece of code will display table that contain actors.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n/code\r\n            HtmlWeb web = new HtmlWeb();\r\n            HtmlDocument HD = web.Load(&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093870/&quot;);\r\n           \r\n            foreach (HtmlNode table in HD.DocumentNode.SelectNodes(&quot;//table[@class=\\&quot;cast\\&quot;]&quot;))\r\n            {\r\n                          MessageBox.Show(&quot; ACTORS:&quot; + table.InnerText);                    \r\n                }\r\n\r\n/code\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I am facing a big roadblock. Let me try to explain. The link that i wrote above (robocop btw), which is http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093870/. Is the link that I received after performing a search.\r\n\r\nIf I go to www.imdb.com, I must do a search. That is easy. After I do search, I am given another page that has many links. Both relevant and irrelevant ones. There is a pattern there, If I search for Robocop, that second screen will give several versions of robocop movies. I am interested in the first link. It even has name Robocop in it.\r\n\r\nHow do I automatically click that link so it can take me to the other page where I can play with agility pack some more.\r\n\r\nI was thinking to extract that link, but I failed miserably at that.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan some help me with that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you very much. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am sorry if the text I wrote is hard to understand.\r\n\r\n",
