There is a part of code where it tries to find a index of a character in HtmlDocument which results in following error\r<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Method not found: 'Int32 HtmlAgility Pack.HtmlDocument.TextIndexOf(Char, Int32)'\r<br />\n<br />\nSo I think the method is deprecated. Any idea about this?\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",
