However, I tried finding the code latest HAP source code, but I was able to find only the version 1.4.0 in the CodePlex repository. I know that the latest version is 1.4.9 according to NuGet packages. Can you guys shed some light or advices on how should I fix this.\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThanks in Advance.<br />\n",
