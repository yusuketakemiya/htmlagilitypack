These are not visible in the output of HtmlWeb.load nor when I directly view the page's source. The only way I can even see these nodes is when I us Firefox's &quot;View Selection Source&quot;. Is there a way to automate this? Or any suggestions to get this in my code?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany Thanks,<br>\r\nChris<br>\r\n",
