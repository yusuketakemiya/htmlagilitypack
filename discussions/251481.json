(So far I could not manage to create a &quot;Reference&quot; to the HAP DLL from Excel, nor to use RegAsm\r\n for registering it sucessfully... at least for me, using Windows 7, Office 2010, .NET FW 4.0.30319.1)</p>\r\n<p>Or, if not, is there a way to get this to work which I have missed?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n",
