    "Description": "In efforts to update make Html Agility Pack's Xpath support to be identical to System.Xml.Xpath I have updated HAP to have HtmlNode and HtmlAttribute implement a base interface. This interface IHtmlBaseNode is now the primary type returned by XPATH operations. Now queries that are trying to just retrieve an HtmlAttribute will do just that. Instead of returning the HtmlNode that includes the attribute. Example, an doc.Document.SelectNodes(\"//@href\") will return a list of HtmlAttribute objects. \n\nThis release is Experimental and does introduce some large breaking changes. Thus I'm putting this in an branch for 2.0 labeled as experimental.\nBreaking Changes:\n* SelectSingleNode returns IHtmlBaseNode\n* SelectNodes returns List<IHtmlBaseNode>\n* SelectNodes will never return null, if no matching elements are found it will return an empty list\n\nThe source code can be found in SVN under branches/2.0.Experimental",

    "Description": "1.4.0 Adds some serious new features to Html Agility Pack to make it work nicer in a LINQ driven .NET World. The HtmlNodeCollection and HtmlAttributeCollection now generic ILists and expose IEnumerable<T> methods to mimic LINQ to XML. This opens an alternative to XPATH for querying the HTML tree. Beyond this 1.4.0 introduces tons of code cleanups and removal of all old non-generic classes (no more arraylists :). \n\n1.4.0 also brings basic msdn like documentation and a new program called HAP Explorer for viewing the HTML tree.\n\nChanges from Beta 2. The biggest changes are better support for character encoding and support for medium trust environments. \n* Removed DescendantNodes() function since it was identical to the Descendants() function.\n* Patch# 4706. Added UserAgent property to HtmlWeb class to be used in webrequests. Minor update to code supplied by radicull\n* Patch# 4432 . Applied HtmlEntity decoding of UniCode html entities supplied by tsai\n* Patch# 4396. Applied UTF-8 changes from JudahGabriel\n* Applied JonGalloways HAPExplorer patch\n* Added Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 Solution\n* Fixed compatibility in Medium Trust environments. Added a default list of extensions and content types to be used when the registry is not available.\n* Updated Charset detection to use a Dictionary<string,string> instead of arraylists of NameValuePair\n* search tag support in HAPExplorer",

The two major additions are newly compiled help documentation and the *Html Agility Pack Explorer*. HAP Explorer is meant to help visualize the node tree of the HtmlDocument object. It supports opening a static file or a url.  \n\n*Release Notes*\n* Added SandCastle/Docproject Documentation project. This will be used to generate Chm and HxS documentation files\n* Added new Html Agility Pack Explorer project. This is a wpf application that can be used to explore the HtmlDocument node tree.\n* Major cleanup on the code base. Ran an Aggressive Resharper code cleanup across the library. Updated XML comments and other minor tweaks for smaller and concise code\n* Included patch for enabling Proxies when getting a url for parsing\n* Fixed XPath property to not include the #document node\n\nThe Documentation project requires [url:Sandcastle|http://www.codeplex.com/Sandcastle], [url:DocProject|http://www.codeplex.com/DocProject] and the [url:Visual Studio 2008 SDK|http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=59EC6EC3-4273-48A3-BA25-DC925A45584D&displaylang=en] installed.

    "Description": "! 1.4.6 Release\nThe only difference between 1.4.5 is a fix for the .NET 2.0 dll in 1.4.5\n\n!! Below are the notes for 1.4.5\n\nThis codeplex release is provided as a courtesy, the preferred method of referencing HAP is through nuget [url:http://nuget.org/packages/HtmlAgilityPack]\n\nThis release includes versions of Html Agility Pack for .NET 2.0 - 4.5, Silverlight 4-5, Windows Phone 7-7.1 and Windows 8 Metro.\n\n!! Windows 8 Metro support\nThe Windows 8 Metro version is a mostly untested port. There is a known bug with Windows 8 Metro HttpClient and basic authentication. This client is used within the HtmlWeb class. Also XPATH is not supported and may never be supported, only LINQ expressions can be used. \n\n!! BugFixes\nThis update fixes a few bugs introduced in the nuget versions since 1.4.0. \n* PreHandleDocumentHandler now fires before the Document is loaded in HtmlWeb\n* Invalid parsing of td tags is fixed\n* Minor speed up of node name retrieval, most notable in LINQ queries\n* Deprecation of DescendantNodes and DescendantNodesAndSelf. These methods will have their implementations changed in the future which will break existing code. It is recommended to use Descendants and DescendantsAndSelf instead\n\n!! Source code structure changes\nMore files have been split into partial classes or refactored to facilitate porting HAP to new .NET target profiles. Since it now not possible to build all versions of HAP in one version of visual studio there are multiple solution files. All solution files have been moved to the Solutions directory to keep items tidy. Test projects (current and upcoming) have been moved to the Tests folder. While all sample projects have been moved to the Samples folder.\n\n!! Getting the Source Code\nDue to Codeplex now supporting tagging source control versions to releases the source zip file is not included here. Please follow the tagged change set number link above to a page where you can download the source code for this release",
