    "Description": "I was creating a new Windows Phone 8 app and when I went to reference HtmlAgilityPack, even after installing the Nuget package I keep being told that VS is unable to find a reference to both it, and HtmlDocumentLoadedComplete.\n\nI tried to create another new project to see if it was just a one off, but it wont work either.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions?",
