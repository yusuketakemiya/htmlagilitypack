    "Description": "Hi,\n\nI am not sure, if this was already raised. ( If it is, I'm very sorry ).\n\nI'm having an issue with the HTML Agility Pack, every time I try to save the document, it always omits the end-tag whenever the said element does not have an inner value.\n\nExample:\nBefore: <meta name=\"metaName\" content=\"metaContent\"/>\nAfter Saving: <meta name=metaName\" content=\"metaContent\">\n\nI believe this is a huge problem not only for design, but also on checking HTML standards.\n\nIf this can be answered, I will be very grateful.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nRespectfully",
