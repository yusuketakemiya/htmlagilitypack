    "Description": "Hi , Thanks for your Great tools.\n\nI see a problem when select tags by XPath . \nI test my code on about 15000 pages and see this problem just on 3 pages !\n\nin these pages : \nhttp://codeforces.com/blog/entry/1700\nhttp://codeforces.com/blog/entry/2359\nhttp://codeforces.com/blog/entry/3542\n\nwhen i try this XPath -> \"//div[@class='topic']/div\"\nhtmlagilitypack must return 8 div tags , but return just first 3 div tags and ignore others !\n\nI thought maybe it is my mistake or because of different page style, but check source code of page and test the XPath in Firebug , too .\n\nI hope you fix it on next version , Thanks a lot.\n\n[ Sorry for my poor english ]",
