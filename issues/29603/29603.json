    "Description": "The NuGet package Id should be \"HtmlAgilityPack\" rather than \"HTML Agility Pack\". It is more standard to not use spaces. This will allow us to install it like:\nInstall-Package HtmlAgilityPack\nrather than:\nInstall-Package \"HTML Agility Pack\"\nÂ \nnot a huge deal, but i had to look up the name to install it since it was not standard.",
