    "Description": "When inputting this html:\n \n<p>Paragraph1<p>Paragraph2</p>\n \nThe InnerHtml property of DocumentNode will contain:\n \n<p />Paragraph 1<p>Paragraph 2</p>\n \nThis essentially means the first paragraph is lost. I don't know if this is a rule or just a suggestion of W3C, but iirc they state that a <p> with no closing tag should be implicitly closed by the next block-level tag. In other words, the second <p> should close the first in this example, which means I'd the InnerHtml to be something like this:\n \n<p>Paragraph1</p><p>Paragraph2</p>",
