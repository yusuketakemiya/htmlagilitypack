    "Description": "At some point I am loading a RSS page into HtmlDocument, using the LoadHtml method. I noticed that the closing tags </link> are lost when I inspect the DocumentElement.OuterHtml  property. The rest looks OK. This is reproducable on different RSS documents from different sites (all UTF-8 formatted) and it goes for all the link elements.\n \nInspecting the _text field on the HtmlDocument itself tells me that it loaded the correct contents: the </link> closing tags are there.\n \nIs this by design, is this indeed a bug or am I doing something wrong here?\n \nThanks!\n \nDavid",
