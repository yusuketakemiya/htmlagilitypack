    "Description": "When actuall using the HtmlNodeNavigator and XSLT's, there is a bug with HtmlNodeNavigator, as the XsltCompiledTransofrm class uses MoveToParent  during attribute enumeration to put the focus on the current attribute's element, not the parent of that element. I believe the following code should be added on line 700 (MoveToParent) of HtmlNodeNavigator.cs:\n \nif (_attindex != -1)\n{\n    _attindex = -1;\n    return true;\n}\n \nWhen I was writing my own XPath navigator for an interface to our database I saw this behavior, and found out MoveToParent is intended to be used this way.  If needed, I can provide an example XSLT and HTML that's very simple and has an infinite loop because of this code not being in MoveToParent.",
