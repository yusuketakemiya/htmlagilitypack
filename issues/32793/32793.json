    "Description": "Hello,\nI have created a WP7 project (OS 7.1) in Visual Studio 2010.\nUsing Nuget I have installed HtmlAgilityPack and now I have the referenced DLL from the folowing path <myProjectDir>\\packages\\HtmlAgilityPack.1.4.3\\lib\\sl4-windowsphone71\\HtmlAgilityPack.dll.\nIn the MainPage constructor I simple have the following line of code :\n \nHtmlWeb htmlWeb = new HtmlWeb();\n \nwith using HtmlAgilityPack; on top.\nWhen I run the app, the MainPage constructor isn't called and the app crashes so the App.cs method RootFrame_NavigationFailed is executed. The exception is the following \"TargetInvocationException\" and \nSystem.TypeLoadException: Could not load type 'HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlWeb' from assembly 'HtmlAgilityPack, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'.\n \nWhy ?\n \nThanks,\nPaolo.",
