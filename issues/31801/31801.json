My Solution contains: ASP.NET MVC 4 Project and regular class libraries projects (i.e. no silverlight or Windows Phone related projects)\n \nGet following error:\n'HtmlAgilityPack' could not be installed because it is not compatible with any project in the solution. The package targets the following frameworks: \nSilverlight, Version = v4.0\nSilverlight, Version= v3.0, Profile=WindowsPhone\nSilverlight, Version= v4.0, Profile=windowsphone71\n \nIf I try to \"Manage\" installed package (for example to remove it), I got little bit different message:\n'HtmlAgilityPack' could not be installed because it is not compatible with any project in the solution. The package targets the following frameworks: \nSilverlight, Version = v4.0\n \nSo can't uninstall or update package using VS 2010 \"Manage NuGet Packages\" dialog",

      "Message": "I think this might be a bug in Nuget. I was able to install HAP 1.4.2 using install-package HtmlAgilityPack -Version 1.4.2 and then run an update. It all worked just fine.\r\n\r\nHAP does not have a dependancy on Silverlight. The Nuget package does include the SL dlls in separate folders since that is one of the big features of Nuget. Package all the different types of your library and allow Nuget to pick the right one for the project.\r\n\r\nI have attached an image of the current nuget package and it's contents.\r\n\r\nI can hardcode that the base dll to be full framework, nuget is supposed to do that by default.
