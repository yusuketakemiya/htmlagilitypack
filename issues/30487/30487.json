    "Description": "Hi,\n \nParsing some sample websites, i received an error saying body element not found.\nI have downloaded the page giving me the error and modified it until body element is not null.\n \nHtmlNode oBody = objDocument.DocumentNode.SelectSingleNode(\"//body\");\n \nIt appears that if a <script> tag is closed with </SCRIPT> instead of </script>, agility pack can't understand the following <body> tag.\nIt also appends this to ParseErrors with the \"Start tag <body> was not found\" string.\n \nThe error disappears when the tag closure matches by case.",
