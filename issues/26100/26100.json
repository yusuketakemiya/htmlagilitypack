    "Description": "I am using HtmlDocument.Save() with an XmlWriter in order to do some special formatting of output.\nÂ \nEverything seems to work great, except that entities (really &amp; in my case) gets written out as &amp;amp;.\nIt appears that the HtmlNode.WriteTo(XmlWriter) sends its \"&amp;\" to XmlWriter.WriteString(), which re-escapes the & in the entity.\nWould using XmlWriter.WriteRaw() be better, or does the encoding of & have to be removed before passing to WriteString() so it can be done correctly?",
