    "Description": "I was finding that some html pages from the wild had html attribute names that started with a number, or were entirely a number, e.g.\n \n<p 2.5=\"\">something</p>\n \nSo a made a patch to htmlagilitypack-63084/Trunk/HtmlAgilityPack/HtmlDocument.cs\nso that such a thing could be output as xml.\n \npublic static string GetXmlName(string name)\n{\n...\n if ((name.Length == 0) || ((!((name[0]>='a') && (name[0]<='z'))) && name[0] != '_'))\n {\n  // to handle attributes names such as 2.4 which is of course garbage.\n  xmlname += \"_\";\n }\n...\n}",
