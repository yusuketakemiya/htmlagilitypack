    "Description": "I have run across some situations when the head tag was not closed. In this case the parser does not detect the body, so it's missing from the HtmlDocument tree.\n\nExample\n\n```\n<html>\n<head>\n   <title>this head is wrong</title>\n\n<body>\n <p>example</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe workaround that I did was to check for the presence of the __</head>__ tag in the text and if not found then add it just in front of __<body__ before loading the HtmlDocument.\n\n```\nif (!html.Contains(\"</head>\"))\n    html = html.Replace(\"<body\", \"</head><body\");\n```\n\nWould be nice to have this fixed in the parser itself.",
