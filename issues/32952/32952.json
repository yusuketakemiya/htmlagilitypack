    "Description": "On Nov 30 2011 at 10:30 AM, I posted issue # 31858 and provided a source code fix for HAP 1.4.0. As far as I can tell, this bug has been ignored and still hasn't made it into the producton 1.4.5.\n \nPerhaps my description was unclear, so let me try to reopen the issue by stating the problem more succinctly.\n \n1) Parse some HTML and get the DOM.\n \n2) Modify the DOM to to change one of the inner nodes.\n \n3) Try to get the HTML for the modified DOM, starting at the root of the DOM.\n \nThe result will be incorrect!!!\n \nBecause of node caching, the node above the one you changed will use the previous information for the changed node, and the updated HTML will *not* be included in the result.\n \nAs stated in http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/workitem/31858, the fix is to set the _innerchanged and _outerchanged to true for all parent (grandparent, etc) nodes when method ReplaceChild is called. I've reproduced my original code from last November here.\n \nAt the end of method ReplaceChild, just before \"return newChild;\", add\n \n    PropogateInnerOuterChanged(_innerchanged, _outerchanged);\n \nThe add the new method\n \n    private void PropogateInnerOuterChanged(bool InnerChanged, bool OuterChanged) {\n\tHtmlNode node = this;\n\twhile (node.ParentNode != null && node.ParentNode is HtmlNode) {\n\t\tnode = node.ParentNode;\n\t\tnode._innerchanged = InnerChanged;\n\t\tnode._outerchanged = OuterChanged;\n\t}\n    }\n \nThe above fix is only 9 lines and fixes what can be a major bug in ReplaceChild. I'm hoping you can incorporate this into your production version, so that we don't have to keep patching the buggy code for every release.",
