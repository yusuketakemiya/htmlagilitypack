    "Description": "Hi Simon,\n \nWe are very interested in your HtmlAgilityPack. We have already try it and this module is very helpful for us.\n \nNow we are creating a freeware/shareware software with a lot of features. One of its features is based on HTML parsing (it loads parameters from HTML). So, we want to include some parts of the 'HtmlAgilityPack' into our software. \n \nAnd we want to know, what limitation does we have?\n \nBest regards,\nMPP Software Limited\n(mppsoftwareltd@gmail.com)",
