    "Description": "Hi,\n \nI've tried to convert a HTML file to a XML file using the OptionOutputUpperCase of the HTMLDocument class but the XML file elements outputed were gibberish characters.\n \nThe sample code I've used was:\n \nHtmlDocument doc = new HtmlDocument();\ndoc.Load(\"cnn.html\");\ndoc.OptionOutputAsXml = true;\ndoc.OptionOutputUpperCase = true;\ndoc.Save(\"cnn.xml\");\n \nDoing some debbuging I think there is a problem in the GetXmlName method of the HtmlDocument class. There's an if where looks like it assumes the name variable is in lowercase but that's not true. The name passed is usually uppercase since the GetXmlName calling code at the WriteTo(TextWriter outText) method has:\n \ncase HtmlNodeType.Element:\n\tstring name;\n\tif (_ownerdocument.OptionOutputUpperCase)\n\t{\n\t   name = Name.ToUpper();\n\t}\n \nSo the GetXmlName method won't go inside this if because characters from A to Z were not included.\n \n// names are lcase\n// note: we are very limited here, too much?\nif (((name[i]>='a') && (name[i]<='z')) ||\n((name[i] >= '0') && (name[i] <= '9')) ||\n//(name[i]==':') || (name[i]=='_') || (name[i]=='-') || (name[i]=='.')) // these are bads in fact\n(name[i]=='_') || (name[i]=='-') || (name[i]=='.'))\n \nI've added this condition in the if statement and it's works fine now.\n \n ((name[i] >= 'A') && (name[i] <= 'Z')) ||",
