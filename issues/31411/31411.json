    "Description": "All searches produce no results. On an XP machine, I was about to give up when it started to work. On a Vista machine it still doesn't work. I've checked in Windows explorer that none of the files are being blocked.\n \nIf I press the [Test Code] button I get an error message \"Error loading file: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\".\n \nI get the same behaviour if I compile the source code. The exception is thrown by line 99 in Window1.xaml.cs (MessageBox.Show( int.Parse(span.InnerHtml.ToLower().Replace(\"downloads\", string.Empty).Trim()).ToString());) as 'span' is null.\n \nTo confirm the bug, I use the search string as used in the GetDocLinks example (//*[@background or @lowsrc or @src or @href]) and that too results in an empty search results (however GetDocLinks appears to work)\n \nVersion is V1.4.0, using VS2008.",
