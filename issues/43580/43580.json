    "Description": "The code scan report said The function Save() in MixedCodeDocument.cs sometimes fails to release a system\nresource allocated by StreamWriter() on line 310 and line 321. I guess StreamWriter did not call sw.Close() so the audthor asked for this, how can I update the code to fullfill this security requirements? Or it is a false alerm? (Checked with latest version, is following can close the connection? \n\npublic void Save(TextWriter writer)\n        {\n            writer.Flush();\n        } \n\nI need a strong reason if need to get exception. Otherrise I need to updated code.",
