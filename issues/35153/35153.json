    "Description": "Hi there,\n\nI have a HTML document that I'm trying to parse using HTML Agility Pack. I then use the XPath Navigator to get the branches that I want to access, once the document is loaded in the DOM. All seems fine, it even bypasses JavaScript in the HTML, but HtmlAgilityPack seems to completely ignore <a> tags. I tried running the debugger in Visual Studio to display the XPath property of an element in the page, and sure enough the XPath property is missing the <a> tag. \n\nPlease advice, this is quite urgent as I've been stuck on this issue for two days now. \n\nRegards,\nJo",
