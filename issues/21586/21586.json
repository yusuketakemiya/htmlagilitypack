P is treated like this because many HTML pages used P like this, as this was actually a (powerful) feature of original HTML. Now that XML and XHTML exist, everybody assumes that this is an error, but it's not (in HTML 3.2).\nCheck the HtmlNode.cs file, and modify the ElementsFlags collection (or do it at runtime if you prefer)",
