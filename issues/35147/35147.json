    "Description": "Hi!\n\nWe started using fortify to scan our builds and the following \"critical issue\" came up:\n\n__XML Injection (Input Validation and Representation, Data flow)__\nOn line 1612 of HtmlNode.cs, the method WriteTo() writes XML unvalidated input.  This call could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary elements or attributes into the XML document.\n\nIf necessary I can also provide the analysis traces, but they are hard to export :/",
