    "Description": "When I try to Load a HtmlDocument from a Stream, it doesn't load correctly.\nI want to load from a MemoryStream. I also tried FileStream and the result is the same: the HtmlDocument isn't null, but it doesn't have any nodes.\nÂ \nWhen I load the same file in the FileStream with the Load(string) method, it loads sucessfully. I don't know what's wrong or if it is an issue.",
