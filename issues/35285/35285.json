    "Description": "Hi all!\nI have an issue with HAP moving my WinForms application from local laptop to Windows Azure Virtual Machine. Azure VM is more powerful than laptop, each CPU-bound operation completes faster on VM.\n\nBut HtmlDocument.LoadHtml method completes much slowly on VM, CPUs not loaded much while this method runs. What can be the reason? Maybe encoding/language issue? Btw. I load cyrillic page. OS on my local machine is cyrillic, on the VM - english. I just cant get what is the reason. Will be glad of any help.",
