    "Description": "If you load an HtmlDocument object using the HtmlWeb.Load method, then set the OptionOutputAsXml property to true, the outerhtml of a meta with a content-type attribute will not be affected if there is a mismatch between the declared encoding in the meta tag and the stream encoding.\n \nThis is because the meta tags OuterHtml property is passed to the AddError message, causing the OuterHtml to be cached.  Once the load method is complete, even if you set the OptionOutputAsXml property of the HtmlDocument, any OuterHtml values of child nodes that are already cached do not get re-calculated.\n \nThis could also affect any other child node who's OuterHtml property is referenced during the Load Method",
