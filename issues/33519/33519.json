    "Description": "I tried using it inside a periodic agent so my app's primary tiles can update.  I tried the following:\n\nprotected override void OnInvoke(ScheduledTask task)\n        {\n            HtmlWeb.LoadAsync(\"URL NAME\", DownLoadCompleted);\n            NotifyComplete();\n        }\n\nbut it seems it does not follow to DownLoadCompleted.  This was working when I was doing it inside the code behind of my main app.",
