    "Description": "I'm trying to parse HTML and convert it to Markdown in a WinRT app, and I've got the following code\n\n```\n            foreach (var x in doc.DocumentNode.SelectNodes(\"//strong\"))\n            {\n                x.ParentNode.ReplaceChild(\n                        HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlNode.CreateNode(\"**\" + x.InnerHtml + \"**\"),\n                x);\n            }\n```\nThis works in .NET4 in an MVC project. Obviously I had to change it as SelectNodes is not available in WinRT, so I replaced that with Descendants\n\n\n```\n            foreach (var x in doc.DocumentNode.Descendants(\"//strong\"))\n            {\n                x.ParentNode.ReplaceChild(\n                        HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlNode.CreateNode(\"**\" + x.InnerHtml + \"**\"),\n                x);\n            }\n```\n\nI've also tried this\n\n```\n            var query = doc.DocumentNode.Descendants(\"strong\");\n            foreach (var item in query.ToList())\n            {\n                var newNodeStr = \"**test**\";\n                var newNode = HtmlNode.CreateNode(newNodeStr);\n                item.ParentNode.ReplaceChild(newNode, item);\n            }\n```\n\nNeither of these work. It seems ReplaceChild in the WinRT build doesn't do what it is supposed to?",
