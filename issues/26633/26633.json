    "Description": "If a comment has three dashes in a row then Replace(\"--\",\" - -\") is no good, because it generates \" - --\" which still has two dashes in a row.\nSo the patch is to change that to Replace(\"--\",\" - - \").\n \nThe smallest legal xml comment is <!----> but the html parser is also accepting <!--> as the smallest legal comment.\nIn fact, even in html I don't think that <!--> is a legal comment. So the parser really should not terminate on that.\n \nBe that as it may, to handle this case there is this patch:\n \nif (s.Length < 7) return(\"\");\n \nNote: I was working from the source code htmlagilitypack-63084/Trunk/HtmlAgilityPack/HtmlNode.cs\n \nI ran a test using over 20 thousand very strange html pages from a real web site. It passed with flying colors.\n \nHere is my final version of the GetXmlComment method.\n \ninternal static string GetXmlComment(HtmlCommentNode comment)\n{\n string s = comment.Comment;\n if (s.Length < 7) return(\"\");\n return s.Substring(4, s.Length-7).Replace(\"--\", \" - - \");\n}",
