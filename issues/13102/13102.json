    "Description": "It would be nice if I could use SelectNodes() from a child node and have it only select those type of nodes from the child nodes rather then from the entire tree.\n \nA good example, would be that I need to find all links from a specific table.  I search for the Table I want, Now all the links I want are child nodes of the table node.  \n \nRight now, if I do TableNode.SelectNodes(\"//a\"), it gets ALL links in the document. \n \nI have coded a work around, but it would be a very useful feature that would save a lot of extra code down the road.",
