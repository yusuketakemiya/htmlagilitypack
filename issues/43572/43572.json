    "Description": "Hello,\n\nI have a question about the implementation of the FindFirst method from the HtmlNodeCollection class.\n\nWhy has it been implemented with a \"Contains\" instead of an equality comparer? It could lead to some issues: for example, if I search an element named \"a\" and the first element of my collection is a \"span\", it will wrongly returns the \"span\" node.",
